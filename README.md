Project for fun! A rhyme app using Flutter and Dart. Has been used ready API service for the backend.

Add own .env file with own API and API key if needed - 

API_URL = ''
API_Key =  ''

If your project will not use an API key, you can modify the rhymes_dio.dart file to remove any code related to handling API keys. Here's a general guideline on how you can modify the file:

1.Open the rhymes_dio.dart file in your project.

2.Look for any code related to setting or using an API key. This could include lines where the API key is assigned to a variable, passed as a parameter to a function, or used in HTTP requests.

3.Remove or comment out the code related to the API key. For example:

4.If there's a line where the API key is assigned to a variable, you can delete or comment out that line.
Save the changes to the rhymes_dio.dart file.

By removing the code related to the API key from the rhymes_dio.dart file, your project will no longer depend on the API key for its functionality. Make sure to review your project's dependencies and any other files that might be affected by this change to ensure that it doesn't cause any issues.
